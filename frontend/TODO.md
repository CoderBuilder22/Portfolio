# TODO: Add Background Images to Project Cards

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Modify ProjectCard.jsx: Remove the card-img-top div and add backgroundImage style to the project-card div for full card background.
- [x] Update Projects.css: Add a dark overlay on the project-card for text readability, change .text-muted color to white, and ensure .card-title is white.
- [x] Update ProjectCard.css: Add z-index to card-body for text visibility over overlay.
- [ ] Verify changes: Ensure images are applied correctly and text is visible.
